## Project Overview
This project was created for our Senior Capstone at Oregon State university. After reviewing multiple project types, our team unanimously agreed to work on a dungeon crawler game with augmented reality components. The goal of the game is to eliminate the enemies on the screen using one of two characters, and then to defeat a boss character.
